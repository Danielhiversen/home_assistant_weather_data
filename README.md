# Weather data

Replaces the old yr sensor.

To migrate from the old yr sensor, replace `- platform: yr` with `- platform: weather_data`

The `weather_data` platform uses [met.no](https://www.met.no/) as a source for current
meteorological data for your location. The weather forecast is delivered by the
Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the NRK.

To add the weather data to your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: weather
```



```yaml

  description: Additional name for the sensors.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: yr
forecast:
  description: If you want to get forecast data instead of the current weather data, set this to the number of hours that you want to look into the future.
  required: false
  type: integer
monitored_conditions:
  description: Conditions to display in the frontend.
  required: false
  type: list
